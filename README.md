Our new yii2 testsuite and mirror for company website www.frenzel.net

This project is based upon the yii2-dev version. It will be the new website for our company...
Currently we are playing around with snippets from phundament (www.phundament.com) and the "vanilla-app".

Although very usefull is the framework tutorial where it's explained how to make a simple CRUD application...;)

Feel free to discuss and/or contribute!
